# SNMF
A example of Semi-NMF that decomposes a  matrix, e.t. a picture, into non-negative martrix.
Experimental results:
Change the variable iter, you can get a set of different sharpness pictures. But every picture we got will less  satisfying 
than original picture which we input.
Because the work of the Semi-NMF algorithm is that reduce the dimension, since we have to lose some features in above process.
